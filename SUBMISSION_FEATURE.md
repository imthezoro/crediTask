# Task Submission Feature

## Overview
The task submission feature allows workers to submit their completed work for client review. This replaces the previous file upload system with a more flexible link-based approach.

## Features

### 1. File Link Submission
- Workers can provide links to their work files (Google Drive, Dropbox, GitHub, etc.)
- At least one file link is required for submission
- Multiple file links can be added
- Empty links are automatically filtered out

### 2. Additional Links
- Workers can provide additional links for live demos, documentation, etc.
- These are optional and separate from file links

### 3. Work Description
- Required text field for describing the completed work
- Should include challenges faced and solutions implemented

### 4. Database Storage
- Submissions are stored in the `submissions` table
- Task status is automatically updated to 'submitted'
- Client receives a notification about the new submission

## Database Schema

### Submissions Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE submissions (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  task_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES tasks(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  worker_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  files text[] DEFAULT '{}',  -- Array of file and link URLs
  comments text NOT NULL,     -- Work description
  verified_by text CHECK (verified_by IN ('ai', 'client')),
  outcome text NOT NULL DEFAULT 'pending' CHECK (outcome IN ('pass', 'fail', 'pending')),
  submitted_at timestamptz DEFAULT now(),
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now(),
  updated_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);
```

## Security

### Row Level Security (RLS) Policies
- Workers can only manage their own submissions
- Clients can view submissions for tasks in their projects
- Notifications can be created by any authenticated user

## Usage

### For Workers
1. Navigate to "My Tasks" page
2. Find an assigned task
3. Click "Submit Work" button
4. Fill in the work description
5. Add file links (required)
6. Add additional links (optional)
7. Click "Submit Work"

### For Clients
1. Receive notification when work is submitted
2. View submission in task management interface
3. Review files and comments
4. Approve or reject the submission

## Error Handling

The system handles various error scenarios:
- Permission denied (RLS policy violations)
- Duplicate submissions
- Missing required fields
- Network errors
- Database connection issues

## File Link Examples

### Supported Platforms
- Google Drive: `https://drive.google.com/file/d/...`
- Dropbox: `https://www.dropbox.com/s/...`
- GitHub: `https://github.com/username/repo`
- OneDrive: `https://1drv.ms/...`
- Any publicly accessible URL

### Best Practices
- Ensure links are publicly accessible
- Test links before submission
- Use descriptive link text
- Provide multiple file formats if applicable

## Technical Implementation

### Components
- `TaskSubmissionModal.tsx` - Main submission interface
- `MyTasksPage.tsx` - Integration with task management

### Key Functions
- `handleSubmit()` - Processes submission and updates database
- `addFileLinkField()` - Adds additional file link inputs
- `updateFileLink()` - Updates file link values
- `removeFileLink()` - Removes file link inputs

### Database Operations
1. Insert submission record
2. Update task status to 'submitted'
3. Create client notification
4. Refresh task list

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- File preview functionality
- Submission templates
- Bulk file upload (if needed)
- Submission history tracking
- Automated quality checks
- Integration with external storage APIs
